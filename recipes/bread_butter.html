        <p>Butter bread is an enriched bread with a rich, buttery, and slightly sweet taste. While readily available at your local bakery, you can also make the delicious bread at home.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups milk</li>

<li>5 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>

<li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>

<li>2 teaspoons salt></li>

<li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>

<li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>1
                In the large bowl of a stand mixer, combine 2 cups milk, 5 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 tablespoon instant yeast. Mix the ingredients to form a dough, adding another ½ cup of flour if needed. Knead with the dough hook for 3 minutes at a low speed.</li>
                
               <li> 2 Add 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, and keep kneading with the dough hook until the butter is fully incorporated and the dough is elastic.</li>
                
                <li>3 In a bowl covered with plastic wrap, let the dough rise for at least 90 minutes. It should double in size.</li>
                
                <li>4 Divide the dough in half, shaping each half into a bread loaf on a floured surface or parchment paper. Place each loaf of dough into a lightly greased 8-inch loaf pan, seam side down. Let the dough rise again, covered, about 2 hours. The loaves should look puffy.</li>
                
                 <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and uncover the loaves.</li>
                
                <li>5 Bake the loaves for 30 minutes. They should look golden brown and produce a hollow sound when you tap them on the bottom. Cool them on a wire rack.</li>
            
        </ol>
